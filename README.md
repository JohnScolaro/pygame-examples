# Pygame Examples

This repo contains examples of some things I've made in Pygame that I think are cool. These examples have been moved from a private repo containing far more code that I don't want to share. Consequently, if you think "This code should be split into multiple files", or "There are no tests?", rest assured that this code is in a much better state somewhere else.

## Setup

How to run the examples:

1. Create a virtual environment for this repository.
2. Install the current repository as a package in your environment with: `pip install -e .`.
3. Run the desired example: `python examples/1_cards/example.py`.
